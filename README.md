Hello, My name is Vidul, Welcome to my Github Page!

I would say my main focus is on using Deep Learning for Time Series forecasting but I do have some experience in Computer Vision as well.

Currently working on some Financial Applications. You can find some useful code to extract and clean data from some popular Indian brokers like Angel Broking & 5Paisa whos APIs are free.

There are some basic model implementation notebooks but the big forecasting ones are still private for now

Upcoming: We are building a License Detection & OCR end to end for the city we currently live in Lavasa, will open source soon
