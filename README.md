Hello, My name is Vidul, Welcome to my Github Page!

I would say my main focus is Time Series forecasting. Learning HuggingFace currently as well cause it's cool.

Working on some Financial Applications. You can find some useful code to extract and clean data from some popular Indian brokers like Angel Broking & 5Paisa whos APIs are free.

There are some basic model implementation notebooks but the big forecasting ones are still private for now

Upcoming: Building a License Detection & OCR end to end for the city we currently live in Lavasa, will open source soon
